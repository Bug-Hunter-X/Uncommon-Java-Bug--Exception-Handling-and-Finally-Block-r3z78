This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Java related to exception handling and the usage of the finally block. The code includes a try-catch-finally block where an ArithmeticException is caught, additional context is added to the exception, and an attempt to modify a variable in the finally block after the exception is thrown. The solution shows how to fix this bug by removing the incorrect modification in the finally block.
